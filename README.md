# New York City Motor Accidents Analysis with Predictive Modelling

## Problem Statement
The problem at hand is the alarming rate of traffic accidents in New York City, posing a significant threat to public safety. These accidents result in injuries, fatalities, and substantial economic costs. The overarching problem is the lack of comprehensive insights and data-driven strategies to effectively mitigate and prevent accidents. This project aims to address this problem by analysing a dataset containing information about traffic accidents in the city.

### Solution
The objective of this comprehensive data science project is to enhance traffic safety and accident analysis in New York City by employing predictive modelling, geospatial
analysis and time-series forecasting techniques.
a. Prediction of seasonal variations in accident rates per borough using Time Series. This predictive model anticipates future accident rates by utilizing historical accident data

b. Geospatial analysis that visually pinpoints areas with a high frequency of accidents, which is crucial for identifying geographical areas that demand focused safety interventions

c. A classification model that can make predictions about the risk severity of a particular place with a given set of inputs, such as time, weather conditions, temperature etc

d. A relevance graph of the most likely causes of accidents at a given place, given a set of inputs. For each neighbourhood, the authorities can plan measures to counter speeding appropriately
