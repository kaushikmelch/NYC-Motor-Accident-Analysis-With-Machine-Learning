To run the NYC Motor Accidents Location Risk Classifer:

1) We first need to import all weather data from openmeteo. This takes 2 days as there are API limitations. The final dataset (final_data.csv) has already been created and located in this folder for Risk Severity Analysis. You can instead use this dataset, and directly run the NYC_Motor_Accidents_Location_Risk_Classifer.ipynb notebook.

2) Use this data set and replace the path defined to it in the NYC_Motor_Accidents_Location_Risk_Classifer.ipynb with your path and run the notebook.

You can check the NYC_Motor_Accidents_Weather_Data_Import.ipynb to see how this dataset was created from the original dataset.
